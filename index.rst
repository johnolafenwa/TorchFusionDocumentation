Official English Documentation for TorchFusion!
===============================================
**TorchFusion** is built to accelerate research and developement of modern AI systems. It is based on **PyTorch** and allows unimpeded access to all of PyTorch's features.
In creating **TorchFusion**, our goal is to build a deep learning framework that can easily support complex research projects while being incredibly simple enough to
allow researchers focus more on research ideas rather than dealing with framework complexity. To achieve this, **TorchFusion** is built with multiple layers of abstractions,
allowing researchers to remain productive while doing research projects needing varying levels of complexity. At all levels of abstraction, **TorchFusion** allows you to
seamlessly use all standard **PyTorch** code and functions including its support libraries. The entire framework is highly decoupled allowing you to take advantage of various features
even without using TorchFusion's trainers.

**TorchFusion** is a project developed by `John Olafenwa <https://john.aicommons.science/>`_ and `Moses Olafenwa <https://moses.aicommons.science/>`_, the `AI Commons <https://aicommons.science/>`_ team. 


The Official GitHub Repository of **TorchFusion** is `https://github.com/johnolafenwa/TorchFusion <https://github.com/johnolafenwa/TorchFusion />`_
